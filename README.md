Setting up and running the project.

1. Unzip the file folder and import the maven project into Eclipse.
2. Once the dependencies are downloaded, right-click on the Restapp and select Run As -> run configuration.
3. Enter the VM argument as shown and click the run button.
4. Once the app is running, open the postman and use the first two screens to test the application.
5. I have used NewRelic to capture the data for the above API and the dashboards. The link to access NewRelic is as follows.

The dashboards are public, so anyone with NR access should be able to view those.
